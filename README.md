Overview
==============
This is an augeas lens that is used to manage a gitolite.conf file.  There are still some additional challenges to managing the gitolite.conf file since it resides in the gitolite-admin repo.  The best way to use this lens is in conjunction with your own custom script to clone and push the gitolite-admin repo before/after changes.
